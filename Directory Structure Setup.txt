# Directory Structure Setup

The following commands will create the necessary empty directories with `.gitkeep` files to maintain the directory structure in the git repository:

```bash
# Create data directories
mkdir -p data/documents
mkdir -p data/archives
touch data/.gitkeep
touch data/documents/.gitkeep
touch data/archives/.gitkeep

# Create logs directory
mkdir -p logs
touch logs/.gitkeep

# Create models directory
mkdir -p models
touch models/.gitkeep

# Create backups directory
mkdir -p backups
touch backups/.gitkeep
```

These directories are used by the application for storing:

- `data/documents`: Document files uploaded to the system
- `data/archives`: Archived documents
- `logs`: Application log files
- `models`: Machine learning models for document classification
- `backups`: Database and configuration backups

The `.gitkeep` files ensure that these empty directories are tracked by git, which normally ignores empty directories.
